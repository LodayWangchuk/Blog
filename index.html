					 <h2>Food</h2>  
					 <h3>October 20 2022</h3>  
					<p>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.</p>

					 <h4>Display of various foods</h4>   
					
                    <p>Plants as a food source are often divided into seeds, fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains and nuts.[29] Where plants fall within these categories can vary with botanically described fruits such as the tomato, squash, pepper and eggplant or seeds like peas commonly considered vegetables.[30] Food is a fruit if the part eaten is derived from the reproductive tissue, so seeds, nuts and grains are technically fruit.[31][32] From a culinary perspective fruits are generally considered the remains of botanically described fruits after grains, nuts, seeds and fruits used as vegetables are removed.</p>

					 <h4>Foods from plant sources</h4>   
					
                 <p>Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly. This includes meat, eggs, shellfish and dairy products like milk and cheese.[59] They are an important source or protein and are considered complete proteins for human consumption as they contain all the essential amino acids that the human body needs.</p>

					<p>Nestled in the mountains is this beautiful Himalayan Kingdom called Bhutan. Popularly known as the Land of the Thunder Dragon and the Land of Happiness, Bhutan has is indeed a gem hidden by mystical mountains and fog. Bhutan is surrounded by Tibet on the north and India on the south west. It consists of 20 districts called the Dzongkhags. Bhutan has been on our bucket list for a long time and we finally decided that it's time to book those tickets and go explore this wonderful country. This is a complete Bhutan Travel Blog for all those planning a trip to this beautiful country. So, how to travel to Bhutan from India?</p>

					<h4>To the Land of the Thunder Dragon</h4>    
					<p>Our first spot of the day was the Buddha Dordenma. On the way we saw the Memorial Chorten but did not enter since we were short of time. Standing at a height of 54 m, the Buddha Dordenma is one of the largest Buddha statues in the world. It is made of bronze and gilded in gold to celebrate the 60th birth anniversary of the fourth king Jigme Singye Wangchuk. Sitting on top of a mountain, it gives a beautiful view of the Thimphu valley.</p>

                    <p>Domendrel hike starts from the base of Tango Monastery. The monastery is considered one of Bhutan's historical monasteries. It belongs to the Drukpa Kagyu school of Buddhism. For the record, Tango Monastery is one of the highest Buddhist Learning Centers in Bhutan. It houses some important relics related to the Kagyu tradition. The hikers will need to pass by the Tango Monastery and hike for another four to five hours to reach Domendrel. Many hikers will opt to do the day-hike to Domendrel.</p>

                <h2>Culture</h2>  
			    <h3>October 19 2022</h3>
                <p>The predominant religion in Bhutan is Buddhism, followed by Hinduism. As a result, Bhutanese culture is very much influenced by sacred Buddhist values. Bhutanese live by their religious values and respect their gods and deities a lot. Hence, there is no dearth of monasteries, chortens, lhakhangs etc in the country. There are colourful prayer flags on hillsides, at the entrance of monasteries etc, which are considered sacred. The Dzong, a unique combination of a fortress and a monastery is present in every district or Dzongkhag of the country.</p>

                <h4>Buddha Dordenma, the Giant Buddha Statue in Thimphu, Bhutan</h4>
                
              <p>The festivals in Bhutan are an exciting affair in the life of the Bhutanese, and an integral part of the unique culture of Bhutan. The most important Bhutanese festival is tshechu. Every city has its own tshechu, which lasts for 3-5 days. It falls on a particular day of a Lunar month (for example, 10th day of 2nd Lunar month). It is generally held in a dzong, where people from the entire district and the surrounding places gather together in harmony to be a part of a mass celebration.</p>

              <h4>Tshechu, a unique Bhutanese Festival celebrated across the Country</h4>
              
             <p>The music and dance forms of Bhutan, which are primarily inspired by religion, are part of every festivals and celebration in the country. In annual events such as, tshechus, king's birthday etc, the whole country celebrates their legacy by dancing and singing. Chham dances, or masked dances, are the national forms of dancing and they are majorly the re-enactment of the scenes from Guru Rinpoche's life.</p>

					<h3>October 18 2022</h3>
            <p>The official national animal of Bhutan is the takin. This unique animal looks like muskox but is more closely related to sheep. Like the muskox, it is a large, stocky animal, with short, thick legs and spurred hooves with two toes. It has curving horns that can grow between 12 and 25 inches. Both sexes have horns. The takin has a coat of long, shaggy wool, and the faces of the males are dark. The animal stands between 38 and 55 inches at the shoulder and has a body length of between 63 and 87 inches. Males weigh between 660 and 770 pounds while females tend to weigh slightly less. Still, whether males or females are larger is uncertain, as the largest captive takin was a female who weighed 710 pounds.</p>

        <h4> National animal takin</h4>
                
            <p>Globally endangered, the tigers are thriving in Bhutan. The kingdom is home to 103 tigers according to the latest population census. They can be found across the country from the lowlands in the south to the elevations of over 4000 metres in the north. What is even better, the tigers move between the different populations in Bhutan, maintaining the much needed genetic exchange.</p>

            <p>Bhutan is home to four big cats: snow leopard, Bengal tiger, leopard and clouded leopard. Not many people know or talk about the snow leopards in Bhutan but they are found living in the high altitude valleys of the Himalayas.</p>
